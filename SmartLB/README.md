Smart Load Balancer

A multi-threaded client-server architecture built with Java sockets, implementing both **static** and **dynamic** load balancing algorithms. Developed for COMP3334 — Computer Networks (Spring 2025) as a socket programming project.

Features

- Dynamic load balancing: Based on real-time server status (IDLE/BUSY).
- Static fallback: Uses round-robin when all servers are busy.
- Handles 4 request types:
  - `COMPUTE:x` → simulate CPU-bound task for x seconds
  - `VIDEO:x` → simulate video streaming for x seconds
  - `FILE:filename.txt` → simulate file transfer
  - `LIST` → returns directory contents
